** kmers_observed(k, sequence) is used to calculate observed kmers given k and sequence
** create_dataframe(l, sequence) is used to create dataframe. l is the length of the dataframe. 
** graph(df) is used to draw a dot graph for possible kmers and observed kmers
** complexity() is used to calculate the lingustic complexity

* The file test_kmers is the script that tests all of the functions above
